<h1>SAW DYNAMIC INPUT</h1>
<p>
    The Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method is often known as the weighted
addition method. The basic concept of the SAW method is to find a weighted sum of the
performance ratings for each alternative on all attributes (Fishburn, 1967) (MacCrimmon,
1968). The SAW method requires a decision matrix normalization process (X) to a scale that
can be compared with all existing alternative ratings[8].
This SAW method requires the decision-maker to determine the weight for each
attribute. The total score for the alternatives is obtained by adding up all the multiplication
results between the rating (which can be compared across attributes) and the weight of each

attribute. The rating of each attribute must be dimension-free in the sense that it has passed
the previous matrix normalization process[9].
The steps for completing the SAW are as follows:
a. Determine the criteria that will be used as a reference in making decisions,
namely Ci.
b. Determine the suitability rating of each alternative for each alternative.
c. Making a decision matrix based on the criteria (Ci), then normalizing the matrix
based on the equation adjusted for the type of attribute (profit attribute or cost
attribute) in order to obtain a normalized matrix R.
d. The final result is obtained from the ranking process, namely the addition and
multiplication of the normalized matrix R with the weight vector so that the
largest value is chosen as the best alternative (Ai) as a solution.
The formula for carrying out the normalization is as follows[7]:
Rij=
{
𝑋𝑖𝑗
max 𝑋𝑖𝑗
min 𝑋𝑖𝑗
𝑋𝑖𝑗
Where Rij is a normalized performance rating; Xij is the attribute value of each criterion; Max
Xij is the greatest value of each criterion; Min Xij is the smallest value of each criterion;
Benefit is the greatest value is the best; Cost is the smallest value is the best. Rij is the
normalized performance rating of the alternatives Ai on attribute Cj; i = 1,2,..., m and j =
1,2,..., n.
The preference value for each alternative (Vi) is given as:
𝑉𝑖 = ∑ 𝑤𝑗 𝑅𝑖𝑗
𝑛
𝑗=1
Where Vi is the ranking for each alternative, Wj is the weighted value of each criterion; Rij
is the normalized performance rating value. A larger Vi value indicates that the alternative
Ai is preferred.
